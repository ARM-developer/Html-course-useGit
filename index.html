            Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
            But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
            'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too
            Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
            Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
