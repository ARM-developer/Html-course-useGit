        Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
        You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
        Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
        And here's an autograph for your brother
        I wrote it on the Starter cap
        I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must have missed you
        Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
        But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?
        I say that shit just clownin', dawg
        Come on, how fucked up is you?
        You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
        To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
        And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
        That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
        I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
        Or maybe you just need to treat her better
        I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
        Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
        If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
        Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
        I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
        I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
        Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
        And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
        And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
        <b>Come to think about, his name was, it was you</b>
        <i>Damn!</i>

            Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
            But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
            'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too
            Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
            Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
